This package provides features that make it easier to clean the census data for
the "green in the city" project. There are modules available with general data
cleaning functions, but also specific modules for cleaning the census data from
the United States (https://data.census.gov/cedsci) and Canada
(https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data?MM=1).
